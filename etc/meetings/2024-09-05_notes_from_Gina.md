## Meeting with Gemeente about the Synthesis project (05/09/2024)

### Expectations for the final product

- **Area**: Municipality and surrounding area, with more attention/detail for the municipality. Also a small part of Den Haag.
- **End users**: Public and municipality employees.
- **Viewer characteristics**: The Gemeente Delft wants something like the 3DUtrecht viewer, which improves a lot on the Netherlands3D page; water movement is better, menu and buttons on the right, trees of different sizes, multiple (publicly available) layers to toggle. Regarding the trees, Utrecht is missing the low crop - which they would like to have (possibly through Cobra dataset?). In Netherlands3d there is an aliasing error - which they would like to avoid.
- **Future Masterplans**: They would like to add 2 layers to demonstrate future urban plans:
  1. Urban masterplan 2D
  2. Urban Masterplan 3D.  
  They will provide us with data for these layers.
- **Adding 3D models**: They would like the possibility to upload building models of higher LoD/quality, when available (eg models they have generated using cyclomedia point clouds/images). We need to decide on the exchange format for the 3D data. We have agreed to receive any open format for now. The possibility of adding a slider for filtering per year was also discussed but this is not a requirement - we do this only if there is time.
- **Documentation and reproducibility**: They want to learn from this project and they would like to be able to reproduce/expand it in the future so documentation and reporting is important.
- **Uncertainty / missing data**: There were some questions about how we plan to visualise uncertainty and missing data.

### Further work

- **Water surface levels**: They have expressed interest in visualising the different elevation levels of the water in the canals. They have not checked if this is possible to derive from AHN. We have said that we can investigate this.
- **Flood modelling**: There was interest in incorporating flood models in the viewer.
- **Water pipe networks**: They have datasets of pipes and they would like to know if it is possible to display them also in the viewer.
- **15-minute city**: They said that they have provided this (GIS) data to Thomas Verbeek and they would like to add it to the viewer. We have said that this is out of scope but, in a later stage, we could have a look to see if we can add it to the viewer.
- **3D from 2D images/reports**: They have said that it might be difficult to acquire the actual 3D buildings models because often the only thing they have is reports with images of the models and measurements. They will try to contract the contractors of these reports to acquire the models but they also expressed interest in generating new 3D models from the reports. Since this would be manual work, we have said that this is out of scope for now.

### Data availability

They have a lot of data in their platform, if something is not publicly available they can provide it through Teams. They still have to decide if Cobra will be visualised or not but for now we will focus on the public data.  
They will provide us with a few examples of Masterplans (2D and 3D) in an open format, links to public layers, and possibly the water pipe network data and Cobra data.

### Working from the Gemeente

Every Thursday from 9 and for the whole day (at least for the first weeks).

### Next meeting

Next Thursday at 9:00, we can meet Herman at the info desk. We will discuss the PID.
