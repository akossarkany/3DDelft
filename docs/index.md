<!-- # Delft3D: Documentation  -->

Delft3D is a web-based 3D application, designed to visualise Delft’s urban
features—such as buildings, vegetation, and water bodies—using open datasets. Developed for the Municipality of Delft,
Delft3D customises the [Netherlands3D](https://netherlands3d.eu/) platform to provide accessible, interactive visualisation for residents and municipal
staff. 

This project was part of [TU Delft MSc Geomatics](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/gm/msc-geomatics) programme's Synthesis Project. It is developed by six 2nd-year MSc Geomatics students, with guidance and assistance from Hugo Ledoux and Gina Stavropoulou from TU Delft, and Mike van Riel from Netherlands3D.

This documentation contains step-by-step instructions for anyone who is interested in creating a 3D environment of a part of the Netherlands.
