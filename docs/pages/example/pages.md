# Github Pages

- Pages are deployed from the `dev` branch. Push your changes to this branch.
- The entry point to pages is /docs/index.md
- Create nice folder structure for pages
- Site is available at [https://akossarkany.github.io/3DDelft/](https://akossarkany.github.io/3DDelft/)
- Use relative paths to reference other files
- Given enough resource we can add theme to our docs with [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)
