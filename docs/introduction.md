## Netherlands3D
[Netherlands3D](https://netherlands3d.eu/) is an open-source digital twin framework developed to provide a unified 3D environment for visualizing datasets across the Netherlands. It allows users to select specific data sources and functionalities based on the project needs, supporting various data formats such as GeoJSON and WFS. Standardized datasets, including [3D BAG](https://3dbag.nl/en/viewer), [BGT](https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/overzicht-van-alle-onderwerpen/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/10-basisregistraties/bgt/), and [AHN](https://www.ahn.nl/), create a consistent 3D model of the Netherlands. The project supports custom environments with specific functionalities and starting locations, and it is designed to facilitate collaboration with external developers, guided by their extensive [techinical documentation](https://netherlands3d.eu/docs/developers/introduction/). As of November 2024, Netherlands3D is actively under development.

## Delft3D
Delft3D is an online 3D viewer for the Municipality of Delft, customized using the Netherlands3D platform. It aims to provide a valuable tool for different stakeholders by enhancing collaboration, data-driven decision-making, and sustainable city management. The platform will provide various use cases in urban planning, design, communication, and development. Along with the future development of Netherlands3D, further features and technical improvements will be added.
