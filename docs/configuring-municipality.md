# 3. Configuring to new municipality

Since this project is intended for a certain municipality, it is possible to restric the movement of the users to a certain area. This is done by specifying the desired region as a polygon in any GIS software and exporting it as a `geojson` file, named `aoi.geojson`. To apply this area of interes to the project, the `aoi.geojson` have to be uploaded alongside the build files. Read more information on the upload [here](./deployment.md#71-upload-application-files).
