# 7. Future
This guide explains how to maintain your Delft3D project while incorporating updates from the Netherlands3D platform. Following these practices will help you stay current with upstream improvements while preserving your Delft-specific customizations.

## Initial Setup
First-time setup for synchronization:

```bash
# Clone your Delft3D repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Delft3D.git
cd Delft3D

# Add Netherlands3D as upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Netherlands3D/twin.git

# Verify your remotes
git remote -v
```

## Regular Update Workflow
1. Prepare Your Local Repository
```bash
# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Ensure your local branch is up to date
git pull origin main

# Backup your work (optional but recommended)
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

2. Fetch Netherlands3D Updates
```bash
# Fetch the latest changes from Netherlands3D
git fetch upstream

# View changes before merging (optional)
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline
```

3. Merge Updates
```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

## Handle Merge Conflicts
1. Review Conflicts
2. Resolve Each Conflict
	* Open conflicted files in your editor
	* Look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
	* Choose appropriate changes while preserving Delft-specific features
	* Use tools like VS Code's merge conflict resolver or:
	```bash
	git mergetool
    ```
3. After Resolution
```bash
# Mark resolved files
git add <resolved-file>

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge Netherlands3D updates and resolve conflicts"
```

## Push Updates and documentation
1. Push the merged changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

2. Track your modifications:
```bash
# Create or update merge documentation
echo "Merge $(date): Updated to Netherlands3D version $(git rev-parse --short upstream/main)" >> docs/MERGE_HISTORY.md
```

## Troubleshooting
If Things Go Wrong
```bash
# Abort a problematic merge
git merge --abort

# Restore from backup
git checkout backup-YYYYMMDD

# Reset to last known good state
git reset --hard origin/main
```
